# Screensaver hijacking

## Instructions

- Compile the payload

```bash
g++ payload.cpp -o payload.exe
```

- Edit `persist.cpp` by setting the payload variable with the actual path to your payload executable

- Compile the persistence program

```bash
g++ persist.cpp -o persist.exe
```

- Run `persist.exe` in order to create the necessary entries in the registry

```bash
./persist.exe
```

- Log out then log in again and wait for 10 seconds (also configurable)

## Result

We get a popup messagebox indicating successful execution of our payload
