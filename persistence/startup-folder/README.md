## Instructions

- Compile the payload

```bash
g++ payload.cpp -o payload.exe

- Edit `persist.cpp` by setting the src variable with the actual path to your payload executable

- Compile the persistence program

```bash
g++ persist.cpp -o persist.exe
```

- Run `persist.exe` in order to create a shortcut to our payload in the startup folder

```bash
./persist.exe
```
